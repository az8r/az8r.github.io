However our packaging and advertising unit have specifically designed the look of the product and our advertiment posters to fit a wide range of audiences, male, female, coding orientated or not as to maximise our market share within this specific tech industry</p>

<h1 id="heading1">Price</h1>
<ul id="text1">
	<h1 id="text2">Pricing Method</h1>
</ul>
<br>
	<p id="text1">Our products will be accordingly regulated upon a cost based pricing system where it subsidises the costs to the business, we have a current markup of 145%. We specifically set this as the markup price lower than most tech companies to entise consumers to spend money of the product but just high enough that we will be able to make a profit within the end of the year.</p>
	<br>
<ul id="text1">
	<h1 id="text2">Positioning</h1>
	<br>
</ul>
<p id="text1">We know we are not the top technological business within our field and that’s why we have set our markup / cost of product to be marginally lower than some of our competitors as we are able to show our product is not highly expensive but reliable and within the higher quality tier.</p>
<br><br><hr style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 350px;"><br>
<h1 id="heading1">Promotion</h1>
	
	<br>
	<p id="text1">Rain pty ltd will use various promotion techniques to pull in consumer attention towards our industry and business, such as</p>
	<br>
	
	<ul id="text1">
		
		<h1 id="text2">Advertising</h1>
			<br>
				<li>Since we know that the computing / programming industry does not appeal to all audiences as food and house loans would, we have chosen to have a more discrete form of advertising. This means we will send out forms to various online based companies including youtube, reddit, data programming based firms etc... to hopefully boost our monthly visits and overall presence in the tech market.</li>
			<br>
		<h1 id="text2">Relationship Marketing</h1>
			<br>
				<li>
				Rain will incorporate many features to our website, server and service to increase customer loyalty and support for the business. This is achieved through adding vibrant colours,a  simplistic design and accessible interface to our website and server as to not discourage any consumers.</li>
			<br>

</p>
	<br><hr style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 350px;"><br>
<h1 id="heading1">Market Segmentation</h1>
