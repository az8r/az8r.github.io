<h1 id="heading1">Business Information</h1>
		<p id="text1">Name: Rain. Rain is a private, online, interactive, forum based website that helps cultivate and expand peoples knowledge of coding and teamwork. It a similar platform to that of reddit were business's or charities can post job threads where the community can participate within to create the desired program, website, etc... Rain however cannot be accessed normally through a browser link as it is a standalone server. To access this server you will have to buy the Rain Modem Box, this will allow you to participate within the posted projects. This concept allows people around the globe to come together to partipate within the creation of a new software or coding based application. Your ability to code and knowledge of different coding languages will determine the projects you will be able to participate in. If you reach title 'Master' you will be able to submit projects for the community to participate in, once accepted by the moderators that it.</p>
