	<br>
	
	<br>
	<ul id="text1">
		<h1 id="text2">Sources of Finance</h1>
		<br>
		<li>Rain Pty Ltd will incur a loan from a bank of $550,000. This is to kick start the business to avoid problems such as insufficient funding. This loan will include for any costs ranging from the 7 - 10 month time period depending on what our sales outcome it. The loan will be paid back at a fixed price over 2 years as we determine that will be when we are able to repay the loan without hindering the companies growth.</li>
	</ul>
	<br><hr style="margin-left: 250px; margin-right: 350px;"><br>
	<h1 id="heading1">Sales Forecast</h1>
	<ul id="text1">
		<h1 id="text2">January</h1>
		<br>
		<li>Since we are still in our establishment stage in January our initial sales will be slow / stagnant due to a number of factors that all new business’s face. These include lack of media attention, high startup costs, low / new presence in the market. We have expected to see a loss in sales for the month, as we are looking to see around 3 customers per day. This adds to a total of 93 units for the month. 
</li>
		<br>
		<h1 id="text2">Febuary - April</h1>
	<br>
		<li>From February through to April, Rain is expected to see an increase of sales, a reduction in startup and additional costs, hence leading to an increased production of units and causing an increased expenditure and less revenue. We are expected to see an average of 16 people per day adding up to 488 units for each month. Which is $212,280 income per month.</li>
		<br>
		<h1 id="text2">May - July</h1>
		<br>
		<li>During May to July sales will increase to a steady / average flow of 782 units per month, hence leading to an expected a total revenue of products only to be $340,170. We will however see a decrease in the “original” monthly cash out (the cash on the table would be different if we didnt cut advertising so the one of the table is the one with advertising cut) as we will cut our advertising budget in half as we have made a local and state wide presence within the tech industry.</li>
		<br>
		<h1 id="text2">August - October</h1>
		<br>
		<li>During this period Rain’s forecasted cash in will exceed cash out, we are also expected to see another jump in sales to an average of 1722 people per month buying units, hence we will see an increase of cash in to the business ($749,070) and a decrease in monthly cash out as due to the production increasing ($650,855). Our expected cash out will also increase as due to the implementation of customer loyalty features such as discounts, vouchers and special perks to keep employee morale and customer engagement high.</li>
		<br>
		<h1 id="text2">November - December</h1>
		<br>

		<li>For these two months Rain will see an expected increase of consumers to 3842 units per month which is $1,671,270 per month. At this stage we will get rid of our advertisement payments as we have made a national presence and we have passed our expected growth for the year.</li>

		<li>The product / modem costs $303 to develop in the factory, to make a profit Rain has set the markup price to be 45% above the cost to make. Therefore the final selling price of the product is $435, leading to a $132 profit on each order.</li>

		<p class="text1">Cash Out</p>
		<br>
		<li>The cash out for the first month is determined by equation: Monthly costs + initial costs + (cost to make product X number of products per month)</li>
		<br>
		<li>The cash out for months Febuary to April is determined by equation: Monthly costs + (cost to make product X number of products per month))
</li>
<br>
		<li>The cash out for months May to July is determined by equation: Monthly costs + (cost to make product X number of products per month) - (Advertising cost  / 2)
</li>
<br>
		<li>The cash out for months August to October is determined by equation: Monthly costs + (cost to make product X number of products per month) + Customer Loyalty features)
</li>
<br>
		<li>The cash out for months November to December is determined by equation: Monthly costs + (cost to make product X number of products per month) - (Advertising costs)
</li>
<br>
	<p class="text1">Cash In</p>
		<br>
	<li>Cash is is determined by the amount of products per month X the selling price for the product ($435)</li>

<li>The break even point shown in the equation is the fixed cost divided by the selling price - the variabble cost. Hence shown in the picture above. This equation gives us our BEP (Break even point) of 979 units until we make a profit.</li>
